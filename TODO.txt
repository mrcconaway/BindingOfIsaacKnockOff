1) Make a main.py
2) Look into pygmes
    * Make a Square box
3) use sprites for hit detenction instead of summoning endless rectangles

other stuff:
- health & health bars
- rooms and how they spawn
- barriers (functionally gaps and walls can be the same but visually gaps/holes and walls want to look different)
- pathing for enemies
- probably more enemies than a perpetual stream of bubbles
- points
- start menu

other other stuff:
- bosses?
- currency system? (probably not for a while because what would you do with it)
- saved games? (harder for sure)
